# python-sportmonks-mariadb-updater
Fetches and inserts/updates required fields from Sportmonks API into mariadb

Please rename _secrets.py to secrets.py and populate required information there such as your API KEY etc.

You can find database structure and creation codes at the end of db.py file which is not their ideal/final location
Eventually I will create a migration like functionality to check database integrity and/or create it from scratch.
